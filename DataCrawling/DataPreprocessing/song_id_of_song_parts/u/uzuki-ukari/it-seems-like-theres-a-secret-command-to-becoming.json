    "key_conclusion": " It Seems Like There's A Secret Command To Becoming is written in the key of E♯ Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 8th most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 80th most popular  among all keys. The E♯ Locrian scale is similar to the E♯ Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (F♯ and B) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of E♯ Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (e#˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the E♯ Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
