    "key_conclusion": " The Zombies Ate Your Brains is written in the key of A Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 4th most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 76th most popular  among all keys. The A Locrian scale is similar to the A Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (B♭ and E♭) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of A Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (a˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the A Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
