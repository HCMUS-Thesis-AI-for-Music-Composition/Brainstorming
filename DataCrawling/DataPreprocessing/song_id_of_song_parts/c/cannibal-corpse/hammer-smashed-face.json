    "key_conclusion": " Hammer Smashed Face is written in the key of D♯ Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 7th most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 79th most popular  among all keys. The D♯ Locrian scale is similar to the D♯ Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (E and A) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of D♯ Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (d#˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the D♯ Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
