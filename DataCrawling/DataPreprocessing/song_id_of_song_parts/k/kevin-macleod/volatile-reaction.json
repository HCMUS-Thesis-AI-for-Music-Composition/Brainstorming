    "key_conclusion": " Volatile Reaction is written in the key of B Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 73rd most popular  among all keys. The B Locrian scale is similar to the B Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (C and F) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of B Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (bËš), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the B Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
