    "key_conclusion": " Animate is written in the key of A Phrygian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 6th most popular key among Phrygian keys and     the 54th most popular  among all keys. The A Phrygian scale is similar to the A Minor scale except that its 2nd note (B♭) is a half step lower.  Chord progressions in Phrygian often rely on the major chord built off of this 2nd scale degree (B♭ major) which gives the key its distinctive sound. \n\nSee the A Phrygian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
