    "key_conclusion": " Let's Summon The Devil is written in the key of C Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 2nd most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 74th most popular  among all keys. The C Locrian scale is similar to the C Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (D♭ and G♭) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of C Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (c˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the C Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
