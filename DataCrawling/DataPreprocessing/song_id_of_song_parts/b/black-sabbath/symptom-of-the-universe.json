    "key_conclusion": " Symptom of the Universe is written in the key of E Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 5th most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 77th most popular  among all keys. The E Locrian scale is similar to the E Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (F and B♭) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of E Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (e˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the E Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
