    "key_conclusion": " Canon in D - Variation in Locrian is written in the key of D Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 3rd most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 75th most popular  among all keys. The D Locrian scale is similar to the D Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (E♭ and A♭) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of D Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (d˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the D Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
