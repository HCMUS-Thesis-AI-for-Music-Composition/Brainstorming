    "key_conclusion": " Spybreak is written in the key of F♯ Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 9th most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 81st most popular  among all keys. The F♯ Locrian scale is similar to the F♯ Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (G and C) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of F♯ Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (f#˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the F♯ Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
