    "metrics_conclusion": " In terms of chords and melody, Blood Sugar is more complex than the typical song, having above average scores in Chord Complexity, Melodic Complexity, Chord-Melody Tension and Chord Progression Novelty. ",
    "key_conclusion": " Blood Sugar is written in the key of G Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 10th most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 82nd most popular  among all keys. The G Locrian scale is similar to the G Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (A♭ and D♭) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of G Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (g˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the G Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
