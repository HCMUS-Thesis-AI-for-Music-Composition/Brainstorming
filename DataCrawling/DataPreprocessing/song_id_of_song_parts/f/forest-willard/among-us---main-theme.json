    "key_conclusion": " Among Us - Main Theme is written in the key of A♯ Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 11st most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 83rd most popular  among all keys. The A♯ Locrian scale is similar to the A♯ Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (B and E) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of A♯ Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (a#˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the A♯ Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
