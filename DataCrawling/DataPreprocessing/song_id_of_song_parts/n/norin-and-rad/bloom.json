The B♭ Dorian scale is similar to the B♭ Minor scale except that its 6th note is a half step higher (G).  Chord progressions in Dorian have a characteristic sound due to the major quality of the chord built on the 4th scale degree. \n\nSee the B♭ Dorian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
