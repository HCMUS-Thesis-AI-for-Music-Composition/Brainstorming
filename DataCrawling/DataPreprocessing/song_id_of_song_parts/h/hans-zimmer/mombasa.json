The A Dorian scale is similar to the A Minor scale except that its 6th note is a half step higher (Fâ™¯).  Chord progressions in Dorian have a characteristic sound due to the major quality of the chord built on the 4th scale degree. \n\nSee the A Dorian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
