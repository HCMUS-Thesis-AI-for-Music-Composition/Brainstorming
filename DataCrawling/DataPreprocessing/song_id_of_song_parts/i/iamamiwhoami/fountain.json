    "key_conclusion": " fountain is written in the key of E Phrygian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the most popular key among Phrygian keys and     the 48th most popular  among all keys. The E Phrygian scale is similar to the E Minor scale except that its 2nd note (F) is a half step lower.  Chord progressions in Phrygian often rely on the major chord built off of this 2nd scale degree (F major) which gives the key its distinctive sound. \n\nSee the E Phrygian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
