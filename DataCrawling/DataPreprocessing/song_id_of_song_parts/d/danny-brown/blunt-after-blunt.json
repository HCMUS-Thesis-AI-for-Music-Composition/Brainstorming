    "key_conclusion": " Blunt After Blunt is written in the key of D Phrygian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 3rd most popular key among Phrygian keys and     the 51st most popular  among all keys. The D Phrygian scale is similar to the D Minor scale except that its 2nd note (E♭) is a half step lower.  Chord progressions in Phrygian often rely on the major chord built off of this 2nd scale degree (E♭ major) which gives the key its distinctive sound. \n\nSee the D Phrygian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
