    "key_conclusion": " The Young Turks Theme is written in the key of C♯ Locrian.  \n\nAccording to the Theorytab database, it is the 6th most popular key among Locrian keys and     the 78th most popular  among all keys. The C♯ Locrian scale is similar to the C♯ Minor scale except that both the 2nd and the 5th notes (D and G) are a half step lower.  This means that the characteristic \"home base\" chord of C♯ Locrian has a dissonant diminished quality (c#˚), which makes it a very uncommon choice for songs.\n\nSee the C♯ Locrian Cheat Sheet for popular chords, chord progressions, downloadable midi files and more!",
