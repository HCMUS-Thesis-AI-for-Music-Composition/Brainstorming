The use of a specific pitch range of 5 octaves creates a cohesive and unified sound throughout this 31 ~ 45-second-long vocal-style musical piece, which is set at a very upbeat tempo. The music is steeped in the traditions of vocal style, and the chosen pitch range helps to create a sense of continuity and coherence, contributing to the overall unity of the composition. The use of piano, percussion, organ, guitar, bass, sax and drum is vital to the music as it provides a powerful and memorable sound through the minor key. The combination of these elements creates a unique and distinctive character for the music that can captivate the listeners attention. Without the piano, percussion, organ, guitar, bass, sax and drum, the music would lack its full potential, and without the minor, it would lose its defining quality. Therefore, the careful selection and use of these components are crucial in creating a compelling and successful piece of music.,
