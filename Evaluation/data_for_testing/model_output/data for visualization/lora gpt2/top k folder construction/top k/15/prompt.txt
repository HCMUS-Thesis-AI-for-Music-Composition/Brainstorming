The musical piece showcases a pitch range within 6 octaves and uses major key to create a distinct atmosphere. It is a 46 ~ 60-second-long song with a rhythm that is neither too fast nor too slow. The music is given its sound through strings, trumpet, trombone, brass, sax, clarinet, piccolo and sound effect and follows a meter of 4/4. With a slow tempo, this music is unmistakably symphony in character.,
