The pitch range of 5 octaves adds a distinctive character to the music, emphasizing its emotional depth. This music's use of major key creates a distinct atmosphere, while its smooth and steady rhythm, with the inclusion of grand piano, drum and bass, further enhances the composition. The music, played at a rapid pace in 4/4, conveys dejection and is complemented by its running time of about 20 seconds."
