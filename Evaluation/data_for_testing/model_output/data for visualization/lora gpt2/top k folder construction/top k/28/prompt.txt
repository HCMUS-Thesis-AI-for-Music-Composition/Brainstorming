The music's limited pitch range of 4 octaves allows for a greater emphasis on the nuances of tone and phrasing, while 4/4 sets the meter of the music. It incorporates synthesizer, drum, guitar and bass to create a complete musical experience. With a slow pace and about 15 bars, this music serves as a prime representation of the pop and rnB style."
