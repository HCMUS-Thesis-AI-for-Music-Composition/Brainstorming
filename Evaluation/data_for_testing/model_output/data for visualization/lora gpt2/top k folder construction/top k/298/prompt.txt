This stage music is brought to life through the use of strings, guitar and flute and is based on a 4/4 time signature, which gives it a distinct rhythmic structure. The music is played at a quick pace, adding to its lively and energetic feel. Overall, the combination of the unique time signature, the quick tempo, and the choice of instruments used creates a dynamic and engaging musical experience. In music composition, the use of a specific pitch range spanning 4 octaves can have a significant impact on the overall sound of a musical piece. By using this range consistently throughout the song, it creates a cohesive and unified sound. This technique can be particularly effective when the song spans a large number of bars, approximately 13 ~ 16, helping to maintain a consistent tone and mood throughout the entire piece.'
