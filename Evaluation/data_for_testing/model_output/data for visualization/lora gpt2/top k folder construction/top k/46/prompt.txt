The music in minor key, with a compact pitch range of 3 octaves, creates a rich and dynamic sonic palette that results in a focused and impactful musical performance. The song, with a running time of 31 ~ 45 seconds and a moderate tempo, is just right for expressing dejection. This is achieved through the use of strings, drum, bass and pipe, bringing the music to life with the meter of 4/4 and around 13 ~ 16 bars in length. Overall, the combination of these musical elements results in a powerful and emotional musical experience.'
