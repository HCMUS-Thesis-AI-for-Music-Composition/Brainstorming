The music's limited pitch range of 3 octaves allows for a greater emphasis on the nuances of tone and phrasing, while its use of major key creates a distinct atmosphere. This about 40-second song incorporates a gentle and relaxing rhythm, complemented by the sound of synth. It follows a 4/4 meter and maintains a balanced beat throughout. Filled with sadness, the music evokes a unique emotional experience."
