The music's limited pitch range of 2 octaves allows for a greater emphasis on the nuances of tone and phrasing, while its use of major key creates a distinct atmosphere. This 31 ~ 45-second song incorporates a gentle and relaxing rhythm, complemented by the sound of grand piano and strings. It follows a 4/4 meter and maintains a balanced beat throughout. Filled with stillness, the music evokes a unique emotional experience."
