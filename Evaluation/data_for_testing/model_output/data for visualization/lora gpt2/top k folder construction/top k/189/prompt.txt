The 31 ~ 45-second song with a limited pitch range of 3 octaves allows for a greater emphasis on the nuances of tone and phrasing, while the major key contributes to its special emotional quality. The rhythm of the song is just right, not too fast or too slow, and the synth, strings and drum play an important role in creating its overall sound. It is performed at a rapid pace, using the 4/4 time signature, and is characterized by its melancholy nature.,
