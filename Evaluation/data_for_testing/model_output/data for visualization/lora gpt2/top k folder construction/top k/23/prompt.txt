The musical piece showcases a pitch range within 4 octaves and uses major key to create a distinct atmosphere. It is a 16 ~ 30-second-long song with a rhythm that is neither too fast nor too slow. The music is given its sound through strings, trombone, bass and horn and follows a meter of 2/4. With a slow tempo, this music is unmistakably jazz in character.'
